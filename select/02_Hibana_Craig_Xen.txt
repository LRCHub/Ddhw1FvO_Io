As my friend would say, "Time to ring some ears"
Bitch, I pull up like Hibana
Pull up like Hibana, nigga
Ah ha, bitch, I... like Hibana
Get the eh, yuh, eh, yuh, eh, yuh

Bitch, I pull up like Hibana
See the shots, rippin' through yo armor
Yo, eh, pullin' like I'm broke
I'm a dick, get me wet, play wit' me and I'ma bust it
Capitao, blow shoot right through your blouse
Leave yo' mouth wide
Leave yo' eyes gouged
Whatchu bout' boy
Like I'm Sledge, hammer slam his head
Crush like a camo
God damn I'm off my meds
I got fame now, pockets on Montagne now
Big knots
Remember I used to trap out of my auntie house
Who want smoke? I got smoke
Like I'm Glaz
I'm a Spetsnaz killa
Kill a nigga when I spaz
Flashbang, my pinky ring bling, bling blow
Bling Ying
Boy don't make me come and breach up the stage now
Hate me but I got rank, I'm a diamond in the rough
You a bronze, coppa
I'm a don dada
One-shotta, kill
Ace when I ADS
Ay, shit get real
I'm a demon when I'm siegin'
Leaving lesions in the flesh

Bleed my enemies

Leave my team a success

Eh, bitch, I pull up like Hibana bitch
Seein' shots, rippin' through yo' armor
Yuh, and I'm hurtin' like I'm broke
I'm a dick, get me wet, play wit' me and I'ma bust it
My beauties are in place!
